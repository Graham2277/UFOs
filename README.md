# UFOs
# Overview
The purpose of the anlaysis was to build an interactive website that allows users to easily lookup UFO sighting data. 

# Results
To easily interact with the website, users may use the filters on the left-hand side of the website to filter UFO sightings by date, city, state, country, and shape. Users may select one filter or a combination of filters to comb through the data. 

# Summary
One drawback to the design of this website is that the user does not know all of the possible options that could be input for a filter. For example, users may not know what to input for shape because not all of the shape options are known. To solve this issue, the filters could have drop-down menus that show all possible input options. This would also solve the issue of user misspellings and errors.
